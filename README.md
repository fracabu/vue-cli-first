# vue-cli-first

This project is a foundational web application scaffolded with Vue CLI, serving as a robust starting point for developing Single Page Applications (SPAs) using the Vue.js framework. It includes basic configurations for development, building, and code quality.

## Key Features

*   **Vue.js Framework**: Built on Vue.js for reactive and component-based user interfaces.
*   **Development Server**: Configured with a hot-reloading development server for efficient and rapid development.
*   **Production Build**: Supports building optimized, production-ready assets for deployment.
*   **Code Linting**: Integrates ESLint for maintaining code quality and consistency across the project.

## Tech Stack

*   **Vue.js**: The progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
*   **Vue CLI**: Standard tooling for rapid Vue.js development.
*   **JavaScript (ESNext)**: Primary programming language.
*   **Sass**: CSS pre-processor for enhanced styling capabilities.
*   **Babel**: For JavaScript transpilation to ensure broader browser compatibility.
*   **ESLint**: For static code analysis and linting.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a development environment running.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Node.js**: LTS version recommended (includes npm).
*   **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **Yarn**.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd vue-cli-first
    ```
    (Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your repository.)

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    Navigate to the project directory and install the required Node.js packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR if you prefer Yarn:
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To run the application in development mode with hot-reloading:

```bash
npm run serve
# OR using Yarn:
yarn serve
```

The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production, which compiles and minifies the assets into the `dist` folder:

```bash
npm run build
# OR using Yarn:
yarn build
```

The compiled `dist` folder can then be deployed to any static file hosting service.

### Linting

To check for and fix linting errors in your code:

```bash
npm run lint
# OR using Yarn:
yarn lint
```
